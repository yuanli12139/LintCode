/*
75. Find Peak Element
There is an integer array which has the following features:

The numbers in adjacent positions are different.
A[0] < A[1] && A[A.length - 2] > A[A.length - 1].

We define a position P is a peak if:

A[P] > A[P-1] && A[P] > A[P+1]
Find a peak element in this array. Return the index of the peak.

Example
Given [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]

Return index 1 (which is number 2) or 6 (which is number 7)

Challenge
Time complexity O(logN)

Notice
It's guaranteed the array has at least one peak.
The array may contain multiple peeks, find any of them.
The array has at least 3 numbers in it.
